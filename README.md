This paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3449906) has been published by TheWebConf (WWW) 2021.

As we implement our approaches by extending [HIBERT](https://xingxingzhang.github.io/hibert.html) and [BART](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart), which has been updated automatically recently,
the codes of our paper will be updated accordingly.
The results of the latest reproduction may be different from those of the paper.

# Keyword-aware Abstractive Summarization by Extracting Set-level Intermediate Summaries
As we implement our approaches by extending HIBERT[https://xingxingzhang.github.io/hibert.html] and BART[https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart], which has been updated automatically recently,
the codes of our paper will be updated accordingly.
The results of the latest reproduction may be different from those of the paper.
Coming soon...
